Project 4

This project implements RDT3.0 over UDP by allowing the user to input parameters such as delayed, lost and errors in packet transmission via the command line.

As the project progresses I will update this readme, however, for now I simply need the server to communicate with a proxy that relays the message to a client.  Until this first goal is achieve there will be no features of RDT3.0 in this project.
